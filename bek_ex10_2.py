# ////// FOR LOOPS PRACTICE //////

# # ////// Example 1 //////
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)
# # range(5) generates sequence of numbers from 0 to 4
# # for loop iterates over this sequence
# # on each iteration value of i is updated to the next number in the sequence
# # print(i) function prints the current value of i

# # ////// Example 2 //////
# fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear', 'peach', 'kiwi']
# print(fruits)
#
# for i in (fruits):
#     print(i)

# # ////// Example 3 //////
# for i in range(1, 11):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(f"{i} is even")
#     else:
#         print(f"{i} is odd")
# # range 1 - 11 will loop through numbers 1 - 10 (up to but not including 11)
# # i % 2 == 0: checks if number divisible by 2 with no remainder. If yes then prints even, if no then else statement prints odd
# # uses f-string to give the number of the iteration with the even/odd response
